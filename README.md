# Firebase Realtime Database | Endorsement App

> This project is a Firebase playground for learning purposes. I used Firebase Realtime Database and finally built a mini application that allows users to post endorsements for others and view the endorsements posted by other users. The app is built using Vanilla JavaScript and powered by Vite.
